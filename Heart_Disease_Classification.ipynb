    "# Predicting heart disease using machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're going to take the following approach:\n",
    "1. Problem definition\n",
    "2. Data\n",
    "3. Evaluation\n",
    "4. Features\n",
    "5. Modeling\n",
    "6. Experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In a statement,\n",
    "> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The original data came from the Cleveland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also a version of it available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "> If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, then we'll pursue the project.\n",

    "## 4. Features\n",

    "This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.\n",

    "1. age - age in years\n",

    "3. cp - chest pain type\n",
    "4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "8. thalach - maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "9. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "10. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
